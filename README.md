Started Learning React-Native by making this very simple App
I learned the fundamentals of react-native like the components used in react-native, styling in react-native, I learned where react and react-native differ from each other,
I learned some best practices to follow while making a react-native app and many all.

Continuing this journey to learn more and make beautiful react-native apps for the community, world and myself.
Open for all kind of suggestions
